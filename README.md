# Smart Flowerpot 🌱💧

## Overview 🌍

The **Smart Flowerpot** is an IoT-based project designed to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Powered by an ESP8266 module, it displays real-time data on an LCD and a web interface, and gives visual alerts using LEDs. This system helps ensure your plants stay healthy and well-watered! 🌿

## Features ✨

- **Soil Moisture Monitoring** 💧  
  Measures soil moisture and indicates the level using four LEDs:
  - **Red LED**: Very dry soil (Moisture < 30%) 🚫
  - **Yellow LED**: Medium moisture (30% ≤ Moisture < 60%) 🌗
  - **White LED**: High moisture (60% ≤ Moisture < 80%) 🌿
  - **Blue LED**: Saturated soil (Moisture ≥ 80%) 🌊

- **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring** 🌡️💨  
  Uses a DHT11 sensor to monitor ambient conditions and displays readings.

- **LCD Display** 🖥️  
  Shows real-time moisture %, temperature, humidity, and mood face.

- **Web Interface** 🌐  
  Access data remotely through a hosted web server with auto-refresh every 5 seconds.

## Components Used 🛠️

- **ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module** 🌐  
- **DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor** 🌡️  
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** 💧  
- **LEDs** (Red, Yellow, White, Blue) 💡  
- **16x2 LCD with I2C Interface** 🖥️  
- **Jumper Wires ** 🔌  

## Web Interface 🌐

The ESP8266 hosts a web page that displays:
- 🌱 **Soil Moisture** (%)
- 🌡️ **Temperature** (°C)
- 💨 **Humidity** (%)
- 😀 **Mood** based on soil condition

Auto-refresh updates data every 5 seconds.

## Application Use Cases 💡
